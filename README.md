Web Scraping COVID-19 Data from Worldometer for Analysis

Objective:
Scrape real-time COVID-19 data from Worldometer's website to analyze global and country-specific statistics for insights and trends.

Key Activities:

Data Collection:

Utilize Python libraries like BeautifulSoup and Requests to scrape COVID-19 data from Worldometer's webpage.
Extract information such as total cases, deaths, recoveries, and active cases for various countries.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Clean the scraped data to ensure consistency and accuracy.
Handle missing values, remove unnecessary characters, and format data appropriately for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Perform EDA to understand the distribution and trends of COVID-19 cases globally and by country.
Visualize data using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to identify patterns and insights.
Geospatial Analysis:

Plot COVID-19 data on interactive maps using tools like Folium to visualize the spread of the virus geographically.
Analyze hotspot regions and compare the impact across different countries.
Time Series Analysis:

Analyze the progression of COVID-19 cases over time using time series analysis techniques.
Identify growth rates, peak periods, and flattening curves to assess the effectiveness of containment measures.
Prediction and Forecasting:

Build predictive models to forecast future COVID-19 trends based on historical data.
Use machine learning algorithms like ARIMA or LSTM to predict case counts, deaths, and recoveries.
Insights and Recommendations:

Provide actionable insights into the spread and impact of COVID-19.
Recommend strategies for policymakers, healthcare professionals, and the public to mitigate the spread of the virus.
